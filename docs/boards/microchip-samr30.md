The SAMR30 board is based on an
[<i class="far fa-file-pdf"/>&nbsp;Microchip SAM R30 Xplained Pro evaluation kit](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/50002612A.pdf)
built on top of an Microchip ARM Cortex M0 micro-controller. This board
also provides an SubGHz radio interface.

The SAMR30 board can reset, debug and program the ARM Cortex M0 through the
embedded debugger (OpenOCD) connected to the gateway USB port. This component also
allows a UART connection to the M0. The input power source is configured
through the power management.

## IoT-LAB special configuration

The serial connection baudrate should be configured at **115200 bauds** in the
firmware.
