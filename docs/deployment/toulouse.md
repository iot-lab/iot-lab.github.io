## Topology

Toulouse testbed is deployed at a building scale, over the first floor of building C of IUT Blagnac. 

* Most of the nodes are fixed at a height of 2.65m and 30cm away from the walls and ceilings on dedicated plastic mounts.
* Some nodes are located on the floor or at an intermediate height to enable 3D localisation experiments.
* The walls are either load-bearing bricks walls or drywalls.
