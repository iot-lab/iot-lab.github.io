<a href="https://www.slices-ri.eu">SLICES-RI</a> (Scientific Large Scale Infrastructure for Computing/Communication Experimental Studies) is a flexible infrastructure designed to support large-scale, experimental research focused on networking protocols, radio technologies, services, data collection, parallel and distributed computing and in particular cloud and edge-based computing architectures and services. Since 2021, SLICES-RI managed to launch <a href="https://www.slices-ri.eu/slices-projects/">several projects</a> to define a common architecture of the targeted infrastructure.

The french node of SLICES-RI, called <a href="https://slices-fr.eu">SLICES-FR</a>, plan to integrate major french infrastuctures of the domain like IoT-LAB and bring them to SLICES-RI. The IoT-LAB is defining a roadmap for a smooth migration SLICES-RI to avoid downtime for the users.
