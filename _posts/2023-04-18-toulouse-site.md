We are proud to announce the arrival of a new IoT-LAB site located in the city of Toulouse (Occitanie).

More precisely the nodes are deployed at the IUT Blagnac, in collaboration with the IRIT/UT2J laboratory.
You can find information about the actual deployment by following this <a href="{{ '/docs/deployment/' | relative_url }}toulouse">link</a>. 

This site is catered towards indoor localisation in varying setups, but can host experiments on other topics such as time synchronisation.

More development will arrive soon.
